### About me ðŸ‘‹

I am currently learning React by introducing JSX, rendering elements, Props, and components. This is to be able to optimize my front-end code. Being able to show my work done in the backend with Java - Python, and JavaScript

Learning to investigate the Holberton way has been incredible. As well as solving their challenges day by day. And the achievement of joining Holberton goes beyond technical knowledge. Soft skills were also developed, such as communication, management of social networks, collaboration, and teamwork. The learning between peers. So today I am grateful for the opportunity to have joined Holberton.

Making an impact on a high-performance team is earning their respect through the knowledge that one can capture and transmit to the team. Demonstrating that you can count on our knowledge to solve obstacles presented by the team. Also facilitating a pleasant work environment. If you forget that you should enjoy each day as if it were the first
